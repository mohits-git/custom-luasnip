# custom-luasnip
Wrote custom react snippet with LuaSnip out of curiosity

### To use this snippet -

**Prerequisite** :
- [LuaSnip](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip) should be installed and setup'ed
- [cmp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp) should be installed with LSP-zero
- Checkout the `setup/lsp.lua` for basic cmp and luasnip setup, you can copy paste it on your local machine at `~/.config/nvim/after/plugin/lsp.lua`

**Add Snippet** : 
- Copy the `luasnip.lua` file from this repository to the file `~/.config/nvim/after/plugin/luasnip.lua` on your local machine.
